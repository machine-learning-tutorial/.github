Hi there ðŸ‘‹! My name is [Andrea Santamaria Garcia](https://ansantam.github.io/) and I am an accelerator physicist interested in machine learning applications to particle accelerators.
I have gathered here some tutorials developed across the years on different machine learning areas.
These presentations and tutorials have been used in master level university lectures and specialized accelerator physics conferences and workshops.
The content is targeted to physicists that have little to no previous experience in machine learning.
Hope you find it useful!

# Machine learning tutorials
Currently available tutorials:
- [Neural networks](https://github.com/machine-learning-tutorial/neural-networks)
- [Bayesian optimization](https://github.com/machine-learning-tutorial/bayesian-optimization)
- [Reinforcement learning](https://github.com/machine-learning-tutorial/reinforcement-learning)

## Disclaimer
These repositories contain theoretical content (lectures) and several hands-on tutorials in Python, developed with care and a considerable amount of time! 
If you find any of the content useful and/or you re-use any of the content we would be grateful if it is correctly cited:
