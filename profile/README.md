Hi there ðŸ‘‹! My name is [Andrea Santamaria Garcia](https://ansantam.github.io/) and I am an accelerator physicist interested in machine learning applications to particle accelerators.

You can find here a series of tutorials (lectures + hands-on Python notebooks) that I have used in master level university lectures and specialized accelerator physics conferences and workshops.

The content is targeted to physicists that have little to no previous experience in machine learning.

Hope you find it useful!
